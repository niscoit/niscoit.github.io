  	<h1> About Me </h1>
  	<h4> <p> I was born in Olympia, WA in 1996, but my family moved to Western North Carolina before I can remember, so the Great Smoky Mountains feel like my true home. When I was 12, my mom and I moved to live with my grandparents in Albany, NY where I eventually graduated from Bethlehem Central High School. I attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where I received a Bachelor's of Science in Biology. After I graduated, I moved to Davis, California to study honey bees at the University of California at Davis in the entomology department. I have always kept my hands busy with various crafts and projects such as knitting and sewing. I also love food, nature, and the outdoors. I currently live in Davis, CA with my boyfriend, and our cat, Maple. </p> <h4>
